# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project is a machine learning analysis of the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. It is part of the **Bharat Intern** internship program. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook: `titanic_pridict_bharatintern.ipynb`.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **Titanic dataset**, which contains information about passengers, including age, gender, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Importing necessary libraries
   - Loading the dataset
   - Checking for missing values
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling
   
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing data distributions
   - Identifying key features affecting survival
   
4. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets
   - Training models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
   - Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

5. **Prediction & Conclusion**
   - Predicting survival status for test data
   - Interpreting results
